## Spectral Clustering of IPAH
This repository contains scripts of the R code used to generate the results in our paper "Biological heterogeneity in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension identified through unsupervised transcriptomic profiling of whole blood".

## System requirements
* An Intel-compatible platform running Windows 10 /8.1/8 /7 /Vista /XP /2000 Windows Server 2019 /2016 /2012 /2008 /2003
* At least 256 MB of RAM, a mouse, and enough disk space for recovered files, image files, etc.
* The administrative privileges are required to install and run Râ€‘Studio utilities.
* A network connection for data recovering over network.
* Tested on RStudio, Version 1.2.5042


## How to run

##### Run pre_clustering_dataset.R
Inputs:  
- RNA-sequencing file (genes x patients) : rnaseq_data
- Clinical variable file (patients x variables) : clinical_data.xlsx

Outputs:  
- Pre clustering ready file : pre_clustering_p_all_tpm.RDS

>Run-time for : 

##### Run p_clustering.R
Inputs:  
- Pre clustering ready file : pre_clustering_p_all_tpm.RDS
- Gene list sorted based on variance(descending order) : sorted_variant_genes.RDS

Outputs:  
- Subgroup memberships for patients : memberships_k5.RDS & memberships_k5.csv


Run-time for 300 genes and 359 patients: <= 1 min
